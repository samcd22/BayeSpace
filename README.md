# ðŸš€ BayeSpace: Installation Guide

This guide walks you through setting up **BayeSpace** inside a Docker container with full VS Code integration. You'll be able to run Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks in a reproducible environment with minimal setup.

---

## âœ… Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- The **Remote - Containers** extension in VS Code

---

## ðŸ“¦ Setup Steps

### 1. Choose your working directory

Decide where you want to work from â€” this is where your `data/`, `results/`, and notebooks will live.

---

### 2. Download the `run.ps1` script

Place the `run.ps1` PowerShell script **directly into your working directory**. This script:

- Builds the BayeSpace Docker image from GitHub
- Creates and starts a container named `bayespace-container`
- Mounts local `data/` and `results/` folders for persistent I/O

---

### 3. Open PowerShell in the working directory

Navigate to the folder where `run.ps1` is located. You can do this by right-clicking in the folder and selecting:

> **"Open in Terminal"** or **"Open in PowerShell"**

---

### 4. Run the setup script

In PowerShell, run the following command to allow the script to execute and start the container:

Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.\run.ps1

---

### 5. Attach VS Code to the container

Once the container is running:

- Open Visual Studio Code
- Press Ctrl+Shift+P (or F1) to open the Command Palette
- Type and select:

Dev Containers: Attach to Running Container
From the list of running containers, select:

bayespace-container

This will open a full VS Code workspace inside the running container, with access to all project files in /BayeSpace.

---

### 6. Install recommended extensions inside the container

VS Code will usually prompt you to install missing extensions. Make sure the following are installed inside the container:

- Python â€” ms-python.python
- Jupyter â€” ms-toolsai.jupyter

These will enable code execution, syntax highlighting, and notebook support.
